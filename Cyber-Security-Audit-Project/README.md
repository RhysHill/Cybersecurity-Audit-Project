Internal Security Audit Simulation: Botium Toys
Project Overview
This project is a hands-on simulation of a real-world internal security audit. The scenario involves Botium Toys, a fictional growing e-commerce business that needed to evaluate its security posture to protect against cyber threats and ensure it complies with industry regulations.

As the analyst on this project, my goal was to step into a realistic situation, analyse the company's environment using provided intelligence, and produce a professional audit report with actionable recommendations, just as I would in a professional cybersecurity role.

Key Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases a practical application of the following cybersecurity skills:

Risk Assessment & Analysis: Identifying and evaluating security risks based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

Compliance Auditing: Assessing adherence to major regulations like PCI DSS (for payment security) and GDPR (for data privacy).

Security Control Evaluation: Analysing the effectiveness of Administrative, Technical, and Physical security controls.

Gap Analysis: Pinpointing specific weaknesses in a company's security infrastructure.

Strategic Recommendations: Developing and prioritising clear, actionable solutions to address identified risks.

Professional Reporting: Communicating complex security findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

The Audit Process
My approach followed a standard audit methodology:

Scoping & Intelligence Review: I started by analysing the provided documents: the audit scope, company assets, and an initial risk assessment report.

Control Assessment: I used this information to complete a detailed controls checklist to determine which security measures were in place and which were missing.

Compliance Review: I performed a compliance check against key requirements of PCI DSS and GDPR to identify any regulatory gaps.

Analysis & Reporting: Finally, I synthesised these findings into a comprehensive audit report, which includes a discussion of the key risks and a prioritised, actionable plan for remediation.

Results & Findings
The audit uncovered several critical risks that required immediate attention, including a lack of data encryption for sensitive customer information, non-existent data backups, and insufficient access controls. These findings, along with a complete, prioritised action plan, are detailed in the full report.
